# Finance Tracker - Web Frontend

Frontend application for Finance Tracker. Coming soon.

## Planned Tech Stack

- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- TanStack Query (React Query) for API state management
- React Router for routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization

## Getting Started

Will be added when frontend development begins.

## API Integration

The frontend will consume the API at `apps/api/FinanceTracker`.

CORS is already configured to allow:
- `http://localhost:3000` (Create React App)
- `http://localhost:5173` (Vite)
